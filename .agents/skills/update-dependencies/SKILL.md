# Research new updates
1. Use https://gradle.org to search for Gradle updates, including Gradle plugins
2. Use https://mvnrepository.com to search for dependency updates
3. Analyze libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties

# Update dependencies
- Update all dependencies in libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties
- Always prefer stable version of dependencies, if possible
- If Gradle fails to resolve newly released versions that are confirmed to exist, use the `--refresh-dependencies` flag (e.g., `./gradlew assembleDebug --refresh-dependencies`)
- Add comments to libs.versions.toml on the versions you decide not to update with an explanation why

# Verify upgrades
1. Run ./gradlew assembleDebug and fix any compilation errors
2. Run all tests with ./gradlew test. Fix any issues caused by failing tests. Never change the tests
   themself.

# Final step
- Summerize all changes in libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties and let the user approve them
- When approved create a commit for the changes named "Update dependencies"
- Push the changes
