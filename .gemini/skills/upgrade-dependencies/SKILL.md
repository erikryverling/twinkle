description: Upgrades the project dependencies
---

- Use https://gradle.org to search for Gradle updates, including Gradle plugins
- Use https://mvnrepository.com to search for dependency updates
- Analyze libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties
- Upgrade all dependencies in libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties
- Always prefer stable version of dependencies, if possible
- If Gradle fails to resolve newly released versions that are confirmed to exist, use the `--refresh-dependencies` flag (e.g., `./gradlew assembleDebug --refresh-dependencies`)
- Add comments to libs.versions.toml on the versions you decide not to upgrade with an explanation why
- Fix any compilation errors
- Verify the changes by running ./gradlew run
- Summerize all changes in libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties and let me approve them
- When approved create a commit for the changes named "Bump dependencies"
- Push the changes
